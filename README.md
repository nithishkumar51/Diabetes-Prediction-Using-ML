# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on input medical parameters.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The model is trained on the popular **Pima Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## ðŸš€ Features
- Input health data via form or script
- Scales input data using `StandardScaler`
- Predicts diabetes (Positive / Negative) using a trained model
- Built with `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
